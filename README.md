# Weather App üå¶Ô∏è

Welcome to the Weather App project! This application allows users to fetch and display current weather information and an hourly forecast based on the inputted city name. The project is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and utilizes the OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve weather data.

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following files:

- **index.html**: The main HTML file that contains the structure of the web page.
- **script.js**: The JavaScript file that handles fetching weather data from the API and updating the DOM with the retrieved information.
- **style.css**: The CSS file that styles the web page, including the layout, colors, and fonts.

## Features

- **Current Weather Data**: Displays the current temperature, weather description, and an icon representing the weather conditions for the entered city.
- **Hourly Forecast**: Provides an hourly forecast for the next 24 hours, showing the temperature and weather icon for each 3-hour interval.
- **Interactive UI**: Includes input validation and error handling to ensure a smooth user experience.

2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

3. Enter the name of the city you want to check the weather for in the input field and click the "Search" button.
